/**
 * The site accent has to reach surfaces that live OUTSIDE the panel.
 *
 * Reported 2026-08-10 with a screenshot: on HDRezka the speed buttons were the
 * site's blue, but the in-player slider next to them was YouTube red. The
 * accent is declared on `.vs-panel[data-vs-site]`, and sliderPosition='video'
 * deliberately moves the slider OUT of the panel into the player's own control
 * bar — where the rule no longer matches and `:root` wins.
 *
 * The fix tags <html> with the site (src/index.ts), so every detached surface
 * inherits. This pins both halves: the stylesheet must carry an html-scoped
 * accent rule, and an element outside the panel must actually resolve to it.
