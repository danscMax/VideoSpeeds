/**
 * The speed confirmation sits in the SAME place in a window and in fullscreen.
 *
 * It did not, and the mismatch was reported as a bug (2026-08-10): the plate
 * hung at the middle of the right edge in a window and jumped to top-centre in
 * fullscreen. Both anchors had a reason — right-edge imitates a native volume
 * indicator, top-centre is the only place a person actually sees on a 1920×1080
 * fullscreen — but a control that moves between modes reads as broken.
 *
 * Only the SCALE may differ. This guards the anchor, not the size.
